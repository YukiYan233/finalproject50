1. Introduction
Background: Overview of Californiaâ€™s wildfire challenges and their economic repercussions.
Problem Statement: The intersection of wildfire policies and their economic impacts on property damage, insurance costs, and recovery expenses.
Objectives:
Quantify wildfire impacts on community economics.
Evaluate the effectiveness of wildfire-related policies using reproducible coding methodologies.
2. Literature Review
Wildfire Trends: Review of increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in California.
Policy Landscape: Key policies addressing wildfire prevention, response, and recovery.
Economic Impacts: Insights from prior research into property damage, insurance, and recovery dynamics.
3. Data and Methodology
Data Sources:
Dataset 1: CAL FIRE wildfire incident reports (location, date, damage estimates).
Dataset 2: Insurance claims and premium data from California Department of Insurance.
Additional Data (if needed): FEMA recovery spending or socio-economic indicators.
Data Wrangling (25%):
Merge datasets on common fields (e.g., location, year).
Reshape data to align with analytical needs (e.g., long vs. wide format).
Handle missing data and ensure data consistency.
Plotting (25%):
Static visualizations:
Example 1: Altair-based trend analysis of property damage over time.
Example 2: Geopandas map showcasing regional wildfire impacts.
Dynamic visualizations:
Develop a Shiny app featuring:
Interactive plot of wildfire incidents by year and region.
Insurance claims distribution by severity level.
Community-level recovery expense analysis.
Reproducibility (10%):
Document all data processing and analysis steps in a .qmd file.
Include clear comments and links to datasets for automated download.
Git Integration (10%):
Use Git for version control with multiple branches for tasks (e.g., data wrangling, plotting, Shiny app development).
Final submission on main branch with a clear commit history.
Optional Text Processing (Extra Credit):
Analyze wildfire-related policy documents using natural language processing (NLP):
Extract key policy themes using topic modeling or sentiment analysis.
Correlate policy sentiment with economic impacts.
4. Analysis and Results
Economic Trends:
Visualize and interpret temporal and regional patterns of wildfire damage.
Insurance Analysis:
Evaluate premium changes and claim distributions.
Recovery Costs:
Assess state and community-level recovery expenditures.
Policy Effectiveness:
Measure the impact of key policies on reducing economic losses.
Dynamic Visualization Insights:
Demonstrate interactivity and real-time exploration of the data.
5. Discussion
Insights: Key takeaways for stakeholders.
Challenges: Addressing data gaps and policy enforcement issues.
Policy Recommendations:
Suggestions for improving policy efficiency and economic resilience.
6. Conclusion
Recap of findings and their significance.
Call for further research and data transparency.
7. References
Comprehensive citation of datasets, policy documents, and academic research.
8. Appendices (if applicable)
Supplementary tables, static plots, and detailed methodology.
Code snippets demonstrating key functions.
